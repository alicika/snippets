# snippets
A temporal repo for gui apps
and my current interest, which is, nn models using pytorch.

## prerequirements:
installer: tkinter <br>
torch experiments: numpy, torch, torchvision

## What you expect to tkinter
Allow you to make a installation of a package on GUI.

Adoption of a package involves a lot of potential mistakes when you do this with your own.
This would be helpful as you come to make some mistakes in front of the terminal.
