A temporal repo for gui apps
and my current interest, which is, I am now trying to implement nn model using pytorch.

## prerequirements:
tkinter
numpy, torch, torchvision, helper

## What I do:
Allow you to make a installation of a package on GUI.
Adoption of a package involves a lot of potential mistakes when you do this with your own.
This would be helpful as you come to make some mistakes in front of the terminal.
