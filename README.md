# snippets
A temporal repo for temporary files and useful snippets.
Just take this as a jotdown in reference to my learning.

## prerequirements:
installer: tkinter <br>
torch experiments: numpy, torch, torchvision

## What you expect to tkinter GUI package installer:
Allow you to make a installation of a package on GUI. <br>

Adoption of a package involves a lot of potential mistakes when you do this with your own.
This would be helpful as you come to make some mistakes in front of the terminal. 

## What I would like to introduce with pytorch app:
Implement some nn networks and get used to it with learn-by-doing.
acknowledge what is going on on transfer learning with pytorch_transfer_learning
