# snippets
A temporal repo for temporary files and useful snippets
and my current interest, which is, models using pytorch.

## prerequirements:
installer: tkinter <br>
torch experiments: numpy, torch, torchvision

## What you expect to tkinter GUI package installer:
Allow you to make a installation of a package on GUI.

Adoption of a package involves a lot of potential mistakes when you do this with your own.
This would be helpful as you come to make some mistakes in front of the terminal. 

## What I would like to get to with pytorch app:
Implement some nn networks and get used to it with learn-by-doing.
Equip knowledge on transfer learning with pytorch_transfer_learning
